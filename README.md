Web Development Project Report: University Alumni Events Website

The project aimed to develop and design a website catering to the university alums, offering them a chance to be abreast of the numerous events that would take place at the university. It listed events in the categories of Professional Development and Campus Events. Each category lists at least three events. It has a Home/Landing Page, an Events section, an About section listing team members and their backgrounds and technical areas of expertise, and a Contact Us page with a reservation form.
